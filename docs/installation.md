# Installation

Now it's time for installing **GDPR CLI**. If you already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) this part is pretty easy. If you don't, please check the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)!

If Node.js is working correctly, you simply have to type the following command in your preferred `terminal` application (for Windows Users `Powershell`):

```bash
npm install -g gdpr-cli
```

If your package manager is `yarn`, you have to change the command accordingly:

```bash
yarn global add gdpr-cli
```

Once it is run through, you're ready to use the **GDPR CLI**!

!> Since it's pre alpha, the help command isn't working correctly for now. Please check the [Usage](usage.md) page instead.
