# GDPR CLI

> A command line tool for checking your website for GDPR compliance.

## What is it?

**GDPR CLI** is a easy-to-use command line tool for checking any given website for GDPR compliance. Since it is based on Node.js, the application is browser- and OS-independant. For everyone, who hasn't installed Node.js, I have planned to publish a pre-installed Package fÃ¼r macOS and Windows as well.

This command line tool scrapes a website for HTML-, CSS- and JavaScript-Files and tries to detect code, which is possibly sending personal data to other services, such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, WordPress and many more.

!> This software is still in early alpha, so please use it at your own risk! If you find a bug or software incompability, please report it immediately by opening a ticket in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/mirkoschubert/gdpr-cli/issues). If you are familiar with Node.js and JavaScript programming, feel free to contribute by forking and/ or sending pull requests.

## Legal Disclaimer

Neither I nor this program are giving any legal advice. **GDPR CLI** can not assist you with your website administration or the preperation of legal documents such as an imprint or a privacy notice. It simply helps you by (unobtrusively) revealing possible security flaws, which could affect the data securitiy of any visitor of your website. For more information please consult your lawyer.
