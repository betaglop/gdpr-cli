**GDPR Check** is a easy-to-use command line tool for checking any given website for GDPR compliance. Since it is based on Node.js, the application is browser- and OS-independant. For everyone, who hasn't installed Node.js, I have planned to publish a pre-installed Package f√ºr macOS and Windows as well.

This command line tool scrapes a website for HTML-, CSS- and JavaScript-Files and tries to detect code, which is possibly sending personal data to other services, such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, WordPress and many more.

### Warning

This software is still in early alpha, so please use it at your own risk! If you find a bug or software incompability, please report it immediately by opening a ticket in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/mirkoschubert/gdpr-check/issues). If you are familiar with Node.js and JavaScript programming, feel free to contribute by forking and/ or sending pull requests.

Neither I nor this program are giving any legal advice. **GDPR Check** can not assist you with your website administration or the preperation of legal documents such as an imprint or a privacy notice. It simply helps you by (unobtrusively) revealing possible security flaws, which could affect the data securitiy of any visitor of your website. For more information please consult your lawyer.

### Installation

For installing **GDPR Check** you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) already installed. If you use `npm`, you can install this package with the following command:

```
npm install -g gdpr-check
```

With `yarn` it is just as easy as that:

```
yarn global add gdpr-check
```

That's all - have fun!

### Usage

The basic usage for this command line tool is:

```
gdpr scan https://your-website.com
```

There are some options already, but they still need some improvement. I will update these usage instructions frequently. Stay tuned!

### Roadmap

* [x] Create the basic structure with an easy UI and a flexible Task manager
* [x] Get some basic information about the website (Meta Data)
* [x] Check SSL Certificate
* [ ] Check for Web Fonts (e.g. Google Fonts & Adobe Typekit)
* [ ] Check for DNS Prefetching
